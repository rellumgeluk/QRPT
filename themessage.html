        <p>Hey there, my name is <a href="github.com/rellumgeluk" target="_blank">Nathalia</a>, and I’ve found you.<br></p>
        <p>Lately, QR codes have become a part of our daily lives — we scan them at restaurants, stores, and events without even thinking twice. <br>But what if I told you that by scanning an unknown QR code, you could be handing over personal data to someone with bad intentions?<br>
        The reality is, QR codes can be easily manipulated to redirect you to malicious
        sites or even steal your information without you knowing. <br>In a world where
        it feels almost impossible to truly keep our data private, we have to be more <br>
        mindful of what we share and where we share it. <br>That's why I decided to raise awareness and remind people to think twice before scanning a random QR code.<br> 
        It's a small step, but it could make a big difference in keeping your data safe.<br>
        
        <p>Thanks for checking it. Stay Safe!</p>
